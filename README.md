# DataExtraction_CSG

This is a project for data extraction from critical crash scenarios so that the data may be used for further testing to improve autonomous driving. The inital part of the code creates bounding boxes around the vehicles present in a car crash scene. The second part of the code deals with taking the "cut-outs" of the outline of the vehicles of the scene in order to be used for making more test scenarios.
